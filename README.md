# VectorOps

VectorOps is a C++ console application tailored for seamless manipulation of nums vectors. Users can effortlessly perform sorting operations, compute statistical measures, append elements, and modify the vector with an elegant and intuitive interface.

### Features:
- **Effortless Sorting**: Sort vectors in ascending or descending order using the insertion sort algorithm.
- **Statistical Insights**: Compute sum, average, maximum, and minimum elements with ease.
- **Dynamic Manipulation**: Append elements or modify existing ones with simple commands.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Navigate operations effortlessly with a visually appealing menu-driven interface.

### Usage:
1. **Compilation**: Compile the source code using any standard C++ compiler.
2. **Execution**: Run the compiled executable to start VectorOps.
3. **Input**: Follow on-screen instructions to input integers, select operations, and manipulate the vector.

## Sample Interaction:
```
Enter numbers to populate the vector, input '000' to finish:
2
4
1
000
Choose an operation:
1. Insertion sort in ascending order
2. Insertion sort in descending order
3. Calculate the sum of elements
4. Calculate the average value
5. Find the maximum element
6. Find the minimum element
7. Add an element to the end of the array
8. Modify an element by index
9. View the array

To exit, type '0'

> 1
Sorted array in ascending order:
1 2 4
```

Experience the elegance and efficiency of VectorOps for all your vector manipulation needs!
